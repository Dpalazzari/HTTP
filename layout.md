*This is a general outline of the files I will build and what they will do*
 GAME.RB
  *this file will be about creating the random number guessing game for iteration 4
    -should keep track of the number of guesses
    -should tell the user if the guess is too high/too low

 PATH.RB
 
  *this file will determine the specs of the different paths required for iteration 2
    -/Hello
    -/datetime
    -/shutdown
    -/word_search
    -/game

 SERVER.RB
  *this is the server I will send requests to (It is different from current server file, which
    is just the rough draft)
